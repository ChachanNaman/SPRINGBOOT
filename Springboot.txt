SpringBoot is a framework for building a application in Java Language
SpringBoot makes it easy to create stand alone production application 
Spring involves lot of manual configuration and lot of exhaustive coding whereareas springboot reduces effort 
Springboot -> Auto Config , Standalone application 
We use @SpringBootApplication for setting up manual spring application context and involves automatic component scanning and embedded server config 


Spring initializer -> 
is used to create springboot projects where i can do configs , can add dependencies, can use buildtool

Buildtool : automates project , can compile , do testing , can packaging at one click automatically
            -> maven , groovy , kotlin
            -> maven converts projects into jar , var 

To write APIs we use SpringWeb dependency 

JAR -> java archive 
WAR -> web application archive 

Maven -> Build automation tool and manage dependencies
        -> Maven opencsv -> have all dependencies , just take one and paste in pom.xml and do maven reload 
        -> automates validate, compile, test, package, verify, install, deploy

Springboot structure ->
.idea : contain files regarding the intelligence not related to springboot



Spring IOC -> 
Inversion of Control -> when we create object by ourself means we have control on it but when 
                        we give a control to someone else thats called Inversion
Dependency Injection -> To implement IOC we need Dependency Injection 
 EX : 3 classes = controller -> services -> repositroy
        and controller want objects of services 
        soo controller class can have objects of services class in 3 way -> 
        Contructor Injection -> pass the reference of Service 
        Setter Injection -> setter method for Service 
        Field Injection -> Not reccomended , loose coupling 

SpringBoot -> it maked the process of setting up any spring project easier and faster 
        On top of Spring -> Spring Boot works

SpringApplication.run -> responsible for creating container in JVM 
                        container is objects from selected classes from class list 

IOC container is inside JVM is itself an object and type of it is Application context
store SpringApplication.run in ApplicationContext 
getBean is used to call the classes in my java file i reffered 
and have to mention in reffered file @Component soo that it get called

Spring Application dont call all the classes , only call who have mentioned @Component
